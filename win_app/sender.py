"""Sending this PC's own keyboard and mouse to the other PC: the mirror of
mac_app/bridge.py's link half, talking to the same receiver.py the other PC's
sender talks to, over a second connection this PC opens outwards.

Two links, not one bidirectional socket. The existing Mac-to-Windows link is
the one used every day, and its sequence, acknowledgement and watchdog
bookkeeping is all sender-shaped; threading a second ownership state through
it would put that link at risk for nothing. This one is opened by this PC, to
the other PC's own listener on the same port number, so it needs no inbound
firewall rule here.

Nothing about the crossing is configured on this side. The Mac names the way
home on its own link -- the Windows edge input comes back through -- and that
is the same physical border this PC pushes out across, so the edge, its
resistance and the other PC's address are all learned rather than typed.

Which way input is flowing is one state across both links: the outbound edge
is armed only while the other PC is not driving this PC, so a pointer the other PC is
moving cannot push itself back out through the border it just came in by.
